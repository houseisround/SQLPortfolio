--The Pizza Runner team now wants to add an additional ratings system that allows customers to rate their runner, how would you design an additional table for this new dataset - generate a schema for this new table and insert your own data for ratings for each successful customer order between 1 to 5.

--customer_id
--order_id
--runner_id
--rating
--order_time
--pickup_time
--Time between order and pickup
--Delivery duration
--Average speed
--Total number of pizzas
--If a Meat Lovers pizza was $12 and Vegetarian $10 fixed prices with no cost for extras and each runner is paid $0.30 per kilometre traveled - how much money does Pizza Runner have left over after these deliveries?
